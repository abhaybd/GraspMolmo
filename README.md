## Generating new data + TaskGrasp-Image

See [DATA.md](DATA.md) for details on generating new data and TaskGrasp-Image.

## Setup

Using a virtualenv (e.g. conda) is highly recommended! This code is tested on Python 3.11, but likely works on other versions.

This codebase can be installed with `pip install -e .`. See [DATA.md](DATA.md) to understand the released data and how to generate more, if needed.
